<h1>PROJECTS</h1>

<h2>Portfolio - Data Analysis Projects</h2>
       In this section, I have listed some of my data analytics projects with a brief description of the technology stack used to solve cases.

<h2></h2>

<h3>Analyzing the Drug Market</h3>
         
**Code:** [Drug Market Analysis](https://github.com/LashawnFofung/Drug-Market-Analysis)
         
**Goal:** To determine which strategy, new drug development or existing drug modification, will maximize expected financial value for Major Pharmaceutical Company (MPC) amidst market uncertainty and new competition.
         
**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset related to drug line development strategies for Major Pharmaceutical Company (MPC). It involved evaluating potential outcomes, probabilities, and payoffs for three strategic actions: new drug development, existing drug modification, and no change. The analysis aimed to provide a data-driven recommendation for MPC's drug line development plan, minimizing risk and maximizing potential returns in a complex market. 
         
**Skills:** Data Analysis , Decision Tree Analysis , Expected Value Calculation , Strategic Decision-making Under Uncertainty
  
         
**Technology:** Excel Data Analysis, Decision Tree Analysis
         
**Results:** Using decision tree analysis, the "Existing Drug Line" strategy was identified as the most financially advantageous option, yielding the highest expected financial value of $3,870.02. This significantly outperformed developing a new drug line ($2,763.08) and maintaining the current approach ($868.39). The analysis strongly recommends that Major Pharmaceutical Company (MPC) immediately prioritize and allocate resources to the modification of its Existing Drug Line.

<h3>Analyzing the Impact of Wellness Participation on Nurse Attrition Rate</h3>
            
**Code:** [Nurse Attrition Linear Regression Analysis](https://github.com/LashawnFofung/Nurse-Attrition-Linear-Regression-Analysis)
            
**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute to nurse attrition, specifically evaluating the impact of an Employee Well-being Program on nurse retention within a major healthcare system
            
**Description:** This project focused on analyzing a dataset of 36 months of Employee Well-being Program participation rates and corresponding nurse attrition rates within a major healthcare system. The objective was to investigate if a statistically significant linear relationship exists between monthly program participation and nurse attrition, and to inform future retention strategies. Linear regression was employed to quantify this relationship, generate a predictive model, and assess statistical significance.
            
**Skills:** Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization, Predictive Modeling
            
**Technology:** Excel Data Analysis
            
**Results:** Using linear regression analysis, a statistically significant negative relationship was identified between the Employee Well-being Program's participation rate and nurse attrition rates (p < 0.01). The model revealed that approximately 75% of the variation in nurse attrition rate can be explained by the variation in program participation rate, indicating a moderate to strong fit (R-squared = 0.7485). The derived linear equation, "Predicted Nurse Attrition Rate = -0.081453147 * Program Participation Rate + 5.268268323," indicates that for every 1% increase in program participation, the nurse attrition rate is predicted to decrease by approximately 0.081%. These findings support the hospital's continued investment in and strategic enhancement of the Employee Well-being Program to stabilize its nursing workforce and reduce turnover costs.

<h2>Portfolio - Strategy Project</h2>

<h3> FO Tread Bikes (Conscious Capitalism)</h3>
          
**Code:** [FO Tread Bikes](https://github.com/LashawnFofung/FO-Tread-Bikes)
            
**Goal:** To determine what factors contribute to sustainable market share growth, optimized financial performance, and overall business success within a dynamic and competitive bicycle manufacturing simulation.
            
**Description:** This project focused on analyzing a comprehensive dataset derived from a multi-quarter business simulation. The simulation required strategic decision-making across all core business functions, encompassing market dynamics (including supply and demand forecasting), financial performance, operational efficiency (from manufacturing to supply chain), product innovation, and market positioning within a competitive industry. The analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of various strategic choices on key performance indicators and overall shareholder value, with an underlying focus on Conscious Capitalism principles.

**Skills:** 
   - <b>Strategic Leadership & Business Strategy:</b> Strategic Planning and Execution, Market Analysis, Competitive Intelligence, Competitive Strategy, Pricing Strategy, Product Portfolio Management, Scenario Planning, Strategic Agility, Adaptive Strategy Development.
   - <b>Financial Management & Accounting:</b> Financial Analysis, Strategic Investment, P&L Management, Financial Modeling, Budgeting, Risk Management.
   - <b>Operations & Supply Chain Management:</b> Supply Chain Management, Process Optimization, Manufacturing Operations, Inventory Management, Production Planning.
   - <b>Marketing & Sales Management:</b> Product Marketing, Sales Channel Optimization, Market Segmentation, Advertising Strategy, Sales Forecasting, Customer Relationship Management (CRM).
   - <b>Human Resources:</b> Talent Management, Workforce Planning, Organizational Culture Development (aligned with Conscious Capitalism).
   - <b>Data Analysis & Decision-Making:</b> Data Cleaning, Data Analysis, Correlation Matrices, Hypothesis Testing, Data Visualization, -Data Interpretation, KPI Tracking, Data-Driven Decision-Making.
   - <b>Professional & Soft Skills:</b> Critical Thinking, Problem-Solving, Executive Presentation, Cross-Functional Collaboration, Stakeholder Management.
            
**Technology:** CRM, MS Office (Excel for analysis and reporting)
            
**Results:** Using comprehensive market simulation data and a robust analytical framework, we identified that strategic investments in fixed manufacturing capacity, directly responding to supply and demand fluctuations, and targeted advertising significantly influence market share and sales volume. Furthermore, pioneering product innovation with 3D-printed carbon fiber technology and robust customer engagement, exemplified by new store openings, were crucial drivers of brand leadership and generated demand. These critical factors collectively contributed to a strong financial performance, culminating in a significant company valuation and a projected Return on Investment (ROI) of 127.68% for the analyzed period. Our strategic adaptations based on continuous performance review enabled us to mitigate challenges and reinforce our competitive advantage.
