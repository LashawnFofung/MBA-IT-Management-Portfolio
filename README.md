<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

<br>

This portfolio showcases my expertise as an <b>MBA in IT Management</b> professional, focused on leveraging strategic thinking and data analytics to drive business value. As a <b>PMP, CSM, CSPO-certified Agile leader,</b> I excel in managing complex IT projects and optimizing product delivery.

<h2>PROJECTS</h2>

- <b>AI Digital Product Strategy</b>
  This project documents an AI Digital Product Strategy centered on redefining news consumption for Gen Z. Driven by a nationwide user survey, my work provided direct, data-backed insights into Gen Z's preferences and revealed a crucial Personalization Paradox and Trust Crisis. The resulting strategy, AI Dimensional Personalization, moves the product from a generic feed to a trustworthy co-pilot by recommending three high-impact features focused on transparency, length, and format, directly addressing the core user frictions identified.
