- <b>AI Digital Product Strategy</b>
  This project documents an AI Digital Product Strategy centered on redefining news consumption for Gen Z. Driven by a nationwide user survey, my work provided direct, data-backed insights into Gen Z's preferences and revealed a crucial Personalization Paradox and Trust Crisis. The resulting strategy, AI Dimensional Personalization, moves the product from a generic feed to a trustworthy co-pilot by recommending three high-impact features focused on transparency, length, and format, directly addressing the core user frictions identified.
